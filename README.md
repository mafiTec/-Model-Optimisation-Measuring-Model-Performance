# -Model-Optimisation-Measuring-Model-Performance
Performance Measurement of Models  Evaluation of a Classification Model Once our model is completed, it is necessary to evaluate its performance; either it is a Classification or Regression model. So for evaluating a Classification model, we have the following ways:  Log Loss or Cross-Entropy Loss: It is used for evaluating the performance of a classifier, whose output is a probability value between the 0 and 1. For a good binary Classification model, the value of log loss should be near to 0. The value of log loss increases if the predicted value deviates from the actual value. The lower log loss represents the higher accuracy of the model. For Binary classification, Log-loss can be calculated as:
# Evaluation of a Classification Model

[Log Loss or Cross-Entropy Loss]
[Confusion Matrix]
[Accuracy]
[Recall or Sensitivity]
[Precision]
[F1 Score]
[AUC-ROC Curve]

# Evaluation of a Regression Model

[Mean Squared Error or MSE]
[Root Mean Squared Error or RMSE]
[Mean Absolute Error or MAE]
[Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)]
[R-squared (coefficient of determination)]
[Adjusted R-Squared]
